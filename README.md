# cs-15-system-accounts-build
Class assignment where we built a list of accounts and can update (add/delete) if you have an account

this was a class assignment where we had to build a database that asked for an email and password. those with access were allowed to add, delete or update accounts.
This is one of the first things I ever worked on.
